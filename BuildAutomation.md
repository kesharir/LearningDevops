# Build Automation: 

- Compile
- Transform
- Unit Tests
- Scan the code for problems
- Report problems
- Eliminate Defects


## Important Notes: 

- Build automation is independent of an IDE
- Machine agnostic
- Automation is fast and saves time + any human errors
- Consistency
- Repeatable & Portable + Reliable

Any particular version of source code can be transformed into a deployable code 
in a consistent way
