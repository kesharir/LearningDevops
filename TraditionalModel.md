# Traditional Team: 

- Dev Team: 
    - Deliver features quickly
    - Goal is speed
    - KPI = speed
- Ops Team: 
  - Maintain stability
  - KPI = stability

Dev Team and Ops Team : Opposite goals

KPI : Key performance indicators

# Devops Culture: 

- Dev and Ops are one team
- Deliver features quickly
- Maintain stability 
- Goal is speed
- Shared Goals
- Time to market

Developers are accountable for stability and operation engineers are accountable for speed of delivery
- Immediate recovery from failures.

## Traditional Silos: 

- Dev
- QA
- Ops

```
Every Team had a wall between them: 
1. QA team find bugs in the code and throws the code to Dev Team

2. Dev team fixes the bugs in the code and throws the code to QA Team

3. QA team does not finds any bugs in the code and throws the code 
to Devops team

4. Devops team finds issues with deployment and throws the code to 
the Dev team

Ops team is measured by the UP TIME of the server and their managers 
are holding them accountable for the instability of the system. 

Neither team has visibility to the other teams domain. Thats why 
one team finger points to another team. 

```

## Devops : 

When developer pushes code a series of steps gets executed :

- Automated Builds 
- Automated Integration
- Automated Testing 
- Automated Deployment 
- Parrallel processing 
- Highly Efficient Teams
- Automated monitoring
- Robust Automation Process
- Automation leads to consistency
